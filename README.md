# Network Foundations: PTW330 portfolio project

This project hosts the Network Foundations team's PTW330 portfolio project.

This project uses [Jekyll][1] and [Vale][2]. Jekyll renders all Markdown documents into static blog pages. This controls how the documents look to viewers in their browser. Vale lints these documents to keep them error-free. It checks for spelling issues, grammatical errors, over-complicated content, and more. Together, they convert the plain text documents in this repository into a vibrant, well-structured site.

The rest of this README page describes how to build and add changes to this project on your local computer.

## How to build this project locally

Build the site on your local computer to see how Jekyll renders your document. Lint, or check, your document for grammatical or spelling errors before you commit it.

### Install gems from `Gemfile`

This project's `Gemfile` lists all the gems that this project needs. You only need to install these gems the first time you build the site.

To install the needed gems:

1. In your terminal, go to the project's root folder.

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/gmarti-web/gmarti-web.github.io.git
    cd gmarti-web.github.io.git
    ```

2. Set the local gem folder.

    This keeps the gems you install for this project scoped to this folder.

    ```console
    bundle config path 'vendor/bundle' --local
    ```

3. Install the project's required gems from the `Gemfile`.

    ```console
    bundle install
    ```

This installs this project's gems to a local folder called `vendor/bundle`.

### Start the server

After you install the gems, use `bundle` to start the Jekyll server:

```console
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

To see the rendered site, go to [http://localhost:4000][8].

### Install Vale

This project uses Vale to check, or lint, for any writing errors.

To install Vale, use your operating system's package manager.

<details>
<summary>Linux, Ubuntu, or Debian</summary>

1. For Linux and Debian, you must install the [Snapcraft][9] daemon. For Ubuntu, which has the daemon pre-installed, skip to step two.

    1. For Linux, remove the `nosnap.pref` file from your native package manager's preference folder. For Debian, skip to step ii.

        ```console
        sudo mv /etc/apt/preferences.d/nosnap.pref ~/Documents/nosnap.bkp
        ```

    1. Update `apt`.

        ```console
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt upgrade -y
        ```

    1. Install `snapd`.

        ```console
        sudo apt install snapd
        ```

1. Install Vale.

    ```console
    snap install vale
    ```

1. Run `vale -v` to check the installation.

This installs Vale and adds it to your `$PATH` variable.

    1. Run `Get-ExecutionPolicy`.

        * If it returns `Restricted`, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process`.

    1. Install Chocolatey.

        ```powershell
        Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
        ```
